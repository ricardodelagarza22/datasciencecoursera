This is the information about the program run_analysis

Step 1: (a) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	(b) read subject training data
	(c) assign row number as the values of ID column
	(d) read training data
	(e) assign row number as the values of ID column
	(f) read activity training data
	(g) y_train = merge(y_train, activity_labels)
	(h) assign row number as the values of ID column
	(i) merge subject_train and y_train to train
	(j) merge train and X_train
	(k) read subject training data
	(l) assign row number as the values of ID column
	(m) read testing data
	(n) assign row number as the values of ID column
	(o) read activity testing data
	(p) y_test = merge(y_test, activity_labels)
	(q) assign row number as the values of ID column
	(r) merge subject_test and y_test to train
	(s) merge test and X_test
	(t) combine train and test

Step 2: (a) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each 		    measurement.
	(b) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each 		    measurement. 

Step 3: (a) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

Step 4: (a) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.

Step 5: (a) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable 	for each activity and each subject.
